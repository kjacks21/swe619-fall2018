The problem with the clone method is that it doesn't allow for any subtypes.
The current implementation of it is correct if we don't create any. 
If we call the method from the subtype (currently commented out in IntSet), 
it would raise a ClassCastException (as shown in the failing test testOldClone) 
due to the fact that it creates a new IntSet instead. 

By changing the implementation of clone to call super's clone method, the
exception doesn't occur. It would create a clone of the super 
(in this case is Object) which is cast to an IntSet. 
Then we would only need to copy over any necessary values, 
which in this case is els.
